# About Sean
I'm Sean McBane; I am studying for a PhD at UT Austin in the Institute for
Computational Engineering and Sciences. I work in the field of inverse problems,
with a specialization in oceanography, and my research goal at this time is to
create an algorithm to solve PDE-constrained optimization problems with
parallelism in the time domain. I believe such an algorithm is possible, simpler
in implementation than space-domain parallelism, and may offer very efficient
parallel speedup. Such a method could greatly accelerate the solution of parameter
estimation and uncertainty quantification problems.

I live in Austin with my wife, Lauren, and our daughter, Fiona. We enjoy
exploring the parks and surroundings in the city and staying at home with our
two cats for company. Lauren and I perform with the
[Austin Handbell Ensemble](https://www.austinhandbells.org/). We are members of
[South Austin Presbyterian Church](http://www.southaustinpres.org/),
where I also provide piano music weekly.

Outside of work, I enjoy working on a programming challenge, playing chess, a
variety of video games, and fantasy novels (especially high fantasy). On a
nice weekend, my activity of choice is discovering a new place in the area to
hike or going for a drive in the country. My other interests include: cars and
driving, horology, pipe smoking and tobaccoes, baseball, and music
(especially classical and metal).
