# Welcome!
This is my personal site; here I collect descriptions of the various projects I
begin and, eventually, abandon. The lion's share of these are related to the art
and science of programming, my favorite occupation. I reserve the right
to write about any other ideas/opinions/hobbies I have.

I've collected a growing set of description pages for projects that I have
undertaken, past and present, under [Projects]({{"/projects" | absolute_url}}).
To learn a bit more about me, please see [About me]({{"/about" | absolute_url}}).
