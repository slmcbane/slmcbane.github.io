# Welcome!
This is my personal site; here I collect descriptions of the various projects I
begin and, eventually, abandon. The lion's share of these are related to the art
and science of programming, as it is my favorite occupation. I reserve the right
to write about any other ideas/opinions/hobbies I think may interest the passing
reader or that I simply want to record.

I've collected a growing set of description pages for projects that I have
undertaken and that are in progress under [Projects](no link yet...). These are
mostly simple description pages. Chronological posts that delve into more detail
on technical aspects are collected under the [blog](link to posts here...).

To learn a bit about me, please see [About me](about me link...). That page also
hosts an unofficial CV.
