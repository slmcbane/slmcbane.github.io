# Welcome!
This is my personal website; I write here about my personal projects, hobbies,
interests, and life in general. Much of the content is related to the art and
science of computer programming - my favorite occupation. As far as academic
research, my studies primarily relate to
[inverse problems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem);
oceanography and, more generally, the numerical solution of [partial differential
equations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation); and
parallel and high performance computing. Outside of my studies at work, I may
write about just about anything.

I have curated a list of projects that I consider interesting enough to share
under the [Projects]({{"/projects" | absolute_url}}) page. There you may find
a general description of each, and possibly more detail where necessary to
understand the purpose or niche of the work. More discussion of technical
details and thought processes will be published in
[blog posts]({{"/blog" | absolute_url}}). Words about life, hobbies, etc.
will also likely be found primarily under the blog. To learn a bit more about
me, see [about me]({{"/about" | absolute_url}}).

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you'll find something here to pique your
curiosity or whet your appetite for discovery.

-Sean
